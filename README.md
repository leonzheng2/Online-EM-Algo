# Online-EM-Algo
Implementation of "Online EM Algorithm for Latent Data Models" (Capp√© O., Moulines E., 2007).

## ToDo List

* Figure 4: plot the convergence of parameters using Online EM Algo.
* Check the sensitivity of Online EM Algo on the initialization.

## Remarks

### Poisson Mixture experiment
* To see convergence, need to change very different lambdas, like [1, 10, 100].
* The Online EM Algo seems to be sensitive to initalization. Sometimes it converges toward the truth, sometimes it doesn't. Check this
